      <description>OSCP After years of certifications, CTFs, and job changes, I finally took and finished the PWKv2 course this year and got my OSCP certification. Of all the certifications I&amp;rsquo;ve worked for, this was unsurprisingly the most time-consuming and difficult to attain.
I started my course right after PWKv2 was released, so I got to be one of the first to see the new material and lab environments. Throughout the process of learning the material and attacking lab machines, I learned a ton and would recommend it to anyone looking to really boost their confidence and expertise.</description>

      <description>Hello!
Having finally gotten this site up and running, I thought it would be time to do an introductory post about who I am and what I&amp;rsquo;ll be publishing here.
Information security is a lifestyle for me as well as a profession. Outside of work, I&amp;rsquo;m usually doing CTFs, researching new methodologies and attack types, and working on a certification or course of some kind.
I want this to be a place where I share things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in different forms.</description>
